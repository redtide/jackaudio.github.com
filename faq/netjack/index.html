                    <h1>How do I use JACK over a network?</h1>
    <p>Before we move onto answering the question "How do I use JACK over a
network?", we must first deal with one of the unfortunate ugly realities
of the open source world: choice. There have been several efforts to
provide JACK-over-a-network.</p>
<p>The most important thing to realize about each of these alternatives is
that they are all <strong>mutually incompatible</strong>. You cannot run netJACK2 on
one machine and netJACK1 on another, or any other combination. Both
"ends" of the network link must be using the same software: netJACK1,
netJACK2 or jack.trip. Each system has some qualititative differences
from the others:</p>
<p>netJACK1, also known as "netone" is designed and implemented primarily by
Torben Hohn, this is the most widely used JACK-over-a-network system. Exists
for Linux, OS X and Windows. Can be run with and without data compression.
netJACK2     Designed and implemented primarily by Romain Moret at GRAME.
Exists for Linux, OS X and Windows. No data compression. jack.trip
Designed and implemented by the Soundwire group at CCRMA at Stanford
University. Exists for Linux, and OS X. No synchronization, variable data
compression.</p>
<h2 id="netjack1">netJACK1</h2>
<p>netJACK1 was originally designed to allow JACK to distribute audio
across a high bandwidth local area network. Later, it was modified to
allow it to use the CELT codec for data compression, thus allow use
across a wide area network with less bandwidth (and more latency and
possible data loss). It uses a master/slave design in which a single
machine runs a JACK server that is connectved to sound card (the
"master") and any number of other machines function as slaves.</p>
<h2 id="netjack2">netJACK2</h2>
<p>Like netJACK1, netJACK2 was primarily focused on allowing JACK to
distribute audio across a high bandwidth local area network. However, it
has the additional property of having a "discovery" system so that both
of the ends of the connection can find each other more or less
automatically. When discovered, each slave appears as a new in-server
JACK client. It has no way to use data compression for use in wide area
networks, and cannot tolerate packet loss. It uses the same master/slave
design as netJACK1.</p>
<h2 id="jack-trip">jack.trip</h2>
<p>jack.trip was originally created for streaming relatively large numbers
of channels across a high bandwidth wide area network. It has been used
multiple times to stream 16-24 channels of uncompressed audio across
Internet2 (a high bandwidth "version" of the internet generally only
accessible to universities and research institutions). It doesn't care
too much about relatively high latency (say, 100msec) which makes it
very useful for some purposes, and not for others. It doesn't try to
provide synchronization between the two ends of the link, and instead
resamples to keep things reasonably aligned.  Fundamentally, it just
connects two independent JACK servers running on separate machines
rather than using the master/slave design of netJACK1/2.</p>
