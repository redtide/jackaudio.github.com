        <p>Just a small heads up to mention that macOS and Windows nightly builds are now available for JACK2.</p>
<p>You can find them in the <a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/actions">JACK2 GitHub actions</a> section, each successful build will have matching artifacts.<br />
When you open a pull request, builds will be automatically generated.<br />
(pending approval from JACK2 maintainers, but there is typically no reason not to approve)</p>
<p>These artifacts include macOS-intel, macOS-universal, Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 32bit and Windows 64bit builds.<br />
Note that neither QjackCtl or JACK-Router are included in these builds, only JACK.</p>

        <p>A new version of JACK2 has just been released.<br/>
You can grab the latest release source code at
<a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases">https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases</a> and macOS/Windows installers at
<a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2-releases/releases">https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2-releases/releases</a>.</p>
<p>This release focuses on 2 main things: <code>jack_position_t::tick_double</code> addition and forced alignment of a few internal data structures.
A few other fixes were made as contributed by developers.</p>
<p>This relase adds <code>tick_double</code> to the <code>jack_position_t</code> struct and <code>JackTickDouble</code> as a validation flag for it.
Since older versions of JACK do not expose this variable, the macro <code>JACK_TICK_DOUBLE</code> is provided, which can be used as build-time detection.<br/></p>
<p>The alignment change is because the packed structure layouts as used in JACK2 need to be naturally aligned in order to be accessed atomically in some systems.
A non-aligned read or write can result in a &quot;Bus error&quot;, which brings down jackd.
This seems to only be relevant on certain ARM systems, as JACK2 was obviously working before this change for most people.<br/>
As a consequence of this change, the internal protocol version was bumped to 9, which <b>requires the restart of the JACK server</b> after the update.</p>
<p>The official changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add jack_position_t::tick_double, and flags around it</li>
<li>Add zalsa &quot;-w&quot; argument to wait for soundcard to be available</li>
<li>Bump internal protocol version to 9 (due to struct alignment)</li>
<li>Fix alignment of fields for atomic accesses</li>
<li>Fix build for platforms needing __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS</li>
<li>Fix compilation of documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>External changes, related to macOS/Windows installer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix macOS microphone permissions on qjackctl macOS app bundle</li>
<li>Update qjackctl to 0.9.4</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, for the rationale behind the transport <code>tick_double</code> API update:</p>
<p>When using JACK transport to sync between clients with precise timing requirements (such as MIDI sequencers) rounding errors would accumulate and eventually make the separate clients out of sync.<br/>
This was observed in Carla and mod-host, which use audio plugins as JACK clients.
Some MIDI plugins could miss notes due to rounding errors.
This change has been deployed in MOD Devices for a couple of releases already and it is known to work (that is, it corrects the situation).</p>
<p>There were discussions on IRC about this potentially be unnecessary, that clients can just use <code>bar_start_tick</code> to store the non-integer part of the tick.<br/>
While the idea could work in theory, supporting it turns out to be non-trivial and from all applications that I have tested none implemented this part correctly.<br/>
Some applications do not set <code>bar_start_tick</code> at all, even though they can be run as transport master.</p>
<p>So since the transport API has padding members available for use and it has been unchanged for several years (so there won't be a need to add more fields in the short or middle term), well let's just go for it.</p>
<p>Here is example code for transport-listening clients:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">double</span> tick;
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-meta-keyword">ifdef</span> JACK_TICK_DOUBLE</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (pos.valid &amp; JackTickDouble)
    tick = pos.tick_double;
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
#endif
    tick = pos.tick;</code></pre>

<a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2-releases/releases">https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2-releases/releases</a>.</p>
<p>This release focuses on 2 main things: adding zalsa internal client and fixing macOS builds in regards to DB/meta-data.<br/>
A few other fixes were made as contributed by developers.</p>
<p>With zalsa now part of JACK2, we are one more step closer to JACK1 feature parity.<br/>
Worth noting that this is purely the client, we still need to add the switches to be able to load internal clients directly from <code>jackd</code> startup command-line.<br/>
Will be interesting to attempt to make this zalsa client also behave as a &quot;slave adapter&quot; like done with ALSA <code>audioadapter</code>, <code>coremidi</code> and <code>winmme</code> drivers.<br/>
Something for a future release.</p>
<p>On macOS, please restart the JACK server after updating to 1.9.18.</p>
<p>The official changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add zalsa_in/out as internal client (based on zita-a2j/j2a and jack1 code)</li>
<li>Fix jack_midi_dump deadlock on close after the jack server is restarted</li>
<li>Fix interrupt signal for linux futex waits</li>
<li>Fix usage of meta-data in official macOS builds (private DB errors)</li>
<li>Log error message when cleaning previous DB (macOS and Windows)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for those unaware of this whole &quot;zalsa&quot; thing...<br/>
This is basically zita-a2j/j2a by Fons Adriaensen repackaged as an internal client instead of being an external standalone tool.<br/>
JACK1 already added this a few years ago.<br/>
This zalsa version is slightly more up to date and with a few new fixes on top.</p>
<p>On supported systems, we can use it by running:</p>
<pre><code>jack_load zalsa_out -i "-d hw:Mio"</code></pre>
<p>This will activate the &quot;Mio&quot; soundcard as an output in the JACK graph.<br/>
You can use <code>jack_unload zalsa_out</code> to deactivate it, or alternatively control the start/stop purely in CLI with:</p>
<pre><code>jack_load -w -a zalsa_out -i "-d hw:Mio"</code></pre>
<p>Which will automatically unload the internal client after Ctrl+C or SIGTERM.</p>
<p>Worth noting that, since internal clients run in the JACK server process,
they will log/print information on that process and not on the <code>jack_load</code> one.<br/>
So watch out for that if you need to debug anything.</p>

<p>This release focuses on improvements to the macOS and Windows binaries, now with macOS universal builds natively supporting Apple M1 hardware.<br/>
On M1 hardware, you can now have native arm64 JACK clients talk to Intel/x64 once and vice-versa.</p>
<p>On Windows, JACK-Router (the special ASIO driver that allows any ASIO-compatible application to talk to other JACK clients)
has been brought back, now integrated with the installer so it is much easier to manage.<br/>
Also, 32-bit and 64-bit clients can now be mixed without any side-effects to the meta-data.</p>
<p>Please restart the JACK server after updating to 1.9.17 on those systems.</p>
<p>The official changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add jack-router to Windows installer, opt-in</li>
<li>Fix jack_control stopping after first command iteration</li>
<li>Fix library compat/current version under macOS</li>
<li>Fix registry keys for Windows, add 32bit compat ones on 64bit</li>
<li>Fix return codes of jackd on success</li>
<li>Ignore DB_VERSION_MISMATCH error on windows, it is expected</li>
<li>Remove old workaround for asio4all, as it breaks with jack-router</li>
<li>Support for arm64 macOS builds</li>
<li>Show welcome and license pages on windows installer</li>
<li>Update QjackCtl used in macOS/Windows installers to v0.9.0, with some commits cherry-picked from develop branch</li>

        <p>An issue was found on the last JACK2 release that caused a few applications to crash on start.<br/>
This is a quick hot-fix for that release. If you are running v1.9.15, please update.</p>
<p>Because of a new release being needed, we took the chance to remove the jack-router Windows code,
as it now belongs <a href="https://github.com/jackaudio/jack-router">in its own repository</a>.<br/>
These two items are the full release.</p>
<p>You can grab the latest release source code at

<p>You can also grab the latest pre-built installers for macOS and Windows at

On other systems, ask your jack2 package maintainer to update to the latest release.</p>
