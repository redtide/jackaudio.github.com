contributions to those discussions came from (in alphabetical order):

Paul Davis was the principal author of the JACK API and of its sample
implementation. Very significant contributions have been made by:

Jack O'Quin frequently acted as the primary maintainer of JACK for long

implementation [jackdmp].
He and Johnny Petrantoni created [JackOSX], including JACK and utilities for OS X.
